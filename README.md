Yatzy Vendor Assessment Kata
============================

Your employer, "Fun & Games AB" are developing a new product. They have decided to outsource 
part of the development to a third party vendor. There are three competing vendors. Your 
job is to assess a sample of their work and recommend which vendor to select. The three samples 
have been anonymized and are called Yatzy1, Yatzy2 and Yatzy3. 

You are free to perform any kind of testing you wish on the three competing implementations, 
when making your assessment.

All three implementations should:

- calculate the Yatzy score for a given roll of 5 dice in a given category. 
- provide a list of available categories.
- accept input in the format: "d1,d2,d3,d4,d5 category" where d1 etc are the dice values and 'category' is the name of the category to score
